This page allows you to add content to a TwoPaneView to automatically rearrange content as it best fits the window.

The TwoPaneView control is designed to help you take full advantage of dual-screen devices automatically, with no special coding needed.

On a dual-screen device, the two-pane view ensures that the user interface (UI) is split cleanly when it spans the gap between screens, so that your content is presented on either side of the gap.
