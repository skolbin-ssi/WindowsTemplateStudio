Add a Feedback link to the settings page to encourage your customers to leave feedback via the Feedback Hub.

Feedback Hub is a preinstalled app that provides a single place to gather feedback on Windows and installed apps. All customer feedback that is submitted for your app through Feedback Hub is collected and presented to you in the [Feedback report](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/feedback-report) in the Windows Dev Center dashboard, so you can see the problems, suggestions, and upvotes that your customers have submitted in one report.
