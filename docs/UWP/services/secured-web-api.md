﻿# Secured Web API

This template will add a ASP.NET Core Web API that validates the JWToken passed by the UWP application.

The protection ensures that the API can only be called by:

* Applications that on behalf of the user request the right scopes.
* Users that have the right application roles.

## Configuration

After adding this service to your app you'll need to register a ClientId for the Uwp App and the Web API and update the configuration:

### Web API Configuration

1. Register Web API: Follow the steps from  https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app to register your Web API.
Update the appsettings.json file with the ClientId, TenantId and Audience.

2. Expose scopes on and roles: Follow the steps from https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis to expose scopes and roles on your Web API.
Update the appsettings.json file with the configured Scope.

3. Configure the app role OrdersReader following the steps on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.

4. Assign users to your Web API follow the steps on https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users.

### UWP Configuration

Register your own Client app following the steps on https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app to be able to access the Web API and configure the Client App to access the Web API following the steps from  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis.

Make sure you configure urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob as a redirect uri as described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.applicationoptions.redirecturi?view=azure-dotnet

Update the App.config's IdentityClientId, ResourceId (WebAPI's ClientID) and WebApi Scope

## Understanding the code

This feature uses Forced or Optional Login from the Identity Service Group. [Learn more about using identity in WinTS generated apps](./identity.md).

### ServiceCollectionExtensions

The ServiceCollectionExtensions adds a AddJwtBearer Middleware to validate the token passed by the UWP App. It is configured to validate Token Issuer, Audience and LifeTime.

JwtBearer exposes two events:

- `OnAuthenticationFailed` which is invoked if there are errors during the authentication failed
- `OnTokenValidated`, which is invoked on successful authentication

### ItemController

The ItemController has two Authorize attributes that check the Claim and User Roles. For more information on claims and role-based authorization see

https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-2.2
