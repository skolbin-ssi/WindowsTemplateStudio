## Nightly / Pre-release feeds for Windows Template Studio

- **Nightly:** <https://www.myget.org/F/windows-template-studio-nightly/vsix/>
- **Pre-release (stable):** <https://www.myget.org/F/windows-template-studio-prerelease/vsix/>

### Nightly / Pre-release instructions

The Pre-release build version allows you to get updates with stable features not officially released yet (so, they are not definitive and may change).  This build starts at 3AM GMT every night.

This feed will have stable extension versions so it is not thought to have breaking changes (and can be installed side by side with the official one), anyway, installing this extension is at your own risk.

Open Visual Studio 2017 and go to **Tools→ Extensions & Updates**, then click on **Change your Extensions and Updates settings** *(bottom left of the 'Extensions and Updates' window)* and create an Additional Extension Gallery. On Visual Studio 2019 you'll find Extensions on a separate **Extensions** Menu.

Then, go again to **Tools→ Extensions & Updates** and using the recently added online gallery *(added under the 'Online' node)*, download and install the Windows Template Studio extension. Note that you will likely need to restart Visual Studio for the install to complete.
